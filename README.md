# 🧾 Ritual Style Scroll - static/style.css

Welcome, remixer. This scroll styles the immersive ritual interface of E’s World Espresso, where fog overlays and golden buttons guide the user through poetic invocation. Brewed with modular precision and mythic flair.

## 🔮 Ritual Layers

- **Red Background (`body.red-bg`)**  
  Deep espresso red sets the tone for invocation. Paired with Georgia serif for timeless resonance.

- **Fog Overlay (`.fog-overlay`)**  
  A blue mist draped across the viewport. Positioned low for mobile elegance. Z-indexed beneath the scroll to whisper, not shout.

- **Golden Buttons (`button`)**  
  Styled with ritual gold (`#d4af37`) and shadowed for depth. Responsive and inviting.

- **Ritual Text (`.ritual-text`)**  
  Large, centered glyphs in golden hue. Designed for invocation headers and scroll titles.

- **Lineage Lists (`ul`)**  
  Modular memory containers. Styled for readability and remix.

- **Restart Links (`a`)**  
  Portal anchors to reset or re-enter the ritual. Styled like buttons, hover-responsive.

## 📱 Responsive Invocation

Mobile scaling ensures the ritual remains intact across devices. Font sizes, padding, and layout adapt gracefully for screens under 600px.

Fog overlay remains anchored to the bottom, casting ambiance without obstruction.

## 🧬 Remix Notes

- All styles are modular and scroll-safe.
- Responsive media queries are consolidated for clarity.
- Z-index layering ensures fog remains ambient.
- Button and link styles are unified for consistency.
